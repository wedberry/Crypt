# Crypt

Author: Edward Berry

This project was assigned in CMS 230: Computer Organization and Architecture

The goal of this project was to demonstrate understanding of the principles of writing programs in C. We were tasked with creating a dictionary-based password cracker. The hashed passwords were stored in a shadow password file. The program determines the actual password by matching them to candidate passwords or mangled varsions of the candidates.
